            Bhugol Khoj is a user-friendly web application designed to analyze text input and extract contextual locations. 
            By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, Bhugol Khoj identifies locations mentioned 
            within the text and plots them on an interactive map, providing users with a visual representation of the geographical 
            context embedded in their textual data.

st.markdown(
   """
            1. **Input Text**: Users can input text directly into the application or upload a text file. This text could be 
               anything from articles, essays, or even social media posts.
            2. **Text Analysis**: Bhugol Khoj employs state-of-the-art NLP algorithms to analyze the input text. It detects 
               mentions of geographical locations, such as cities, countries, or landmarks.
            3. **Location Extraction**: The application extracts the most relevant contextual location from the input text. 
               This could be a city, country, or specific landmark mentioned within the text.
            4. **Geographical Visualization**: Bhugol Khoj then plots the extracted location on an interactive map, allowing 
               users to explore the geographical context of the text visually.
            5. **Additional Insights**: Users can also view additional insights, such as the origin country of the text (if 
               different from the contextual location) and the translated text (if the original text is not in English).
